## Why make this?
Because I want to be fully transparent and give the possibility to members who like what they see to implement it themselves. I have done my best to add the best documentation and explaination on how to add these commands + edit them. I am also aware the code might not be completely optimized but that doesn't matter to me. If you have any suggestions you are more than welcome to inform me but because this is not something as serious as university it may take somet time to be fixed.

## License
There is an MIT license attatched to the code that I have made. All code not made by me is clearly mentioned and credited. As far as I know there is no infraction of the license but if there is please let me know so I can resolve it.
