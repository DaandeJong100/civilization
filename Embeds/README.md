# Embeds
The following pieces of code are just the embeds for the server. I have provided a template in the template folder.

## Using the template
If you want to use the provided template you can add a custom command with your own version The `Type:` Command and the `Trigger:` is whatever you want to fill in yourself.

## More information
To see how to add more stuff to the embeds please check out [YAGPDB Embed documentation](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/reference/custom-embeds).
